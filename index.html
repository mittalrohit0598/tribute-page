The blueprints were burned, which destroyed the World Government's attempt to raise an ancient weapon to end the pirate age, and they needed Robin so they can get her to tell them where the ancient weapon is, but failed to retrieve her. After losing their first ship, the Going Merry, due to damage it took, the Straw Hat Pirates get a new one, the Thousand Sunny, and a shipwright, the cyborg Franky, not to mention reobtaining their sniper and archaeologist.

Luffy's father is revealed to be the most wanted man, The Revolutionary, Monkey D. Dragon. The entire crew also earned a new set of bounties, for their actions in Enies Lobby.
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sabaody Archipelago: </strong>Attacked a World Noble, ended up freeing the slaves in the Auction House, and sent the entire island in a panic. As a result, Admiral Kizaru arrived, the Straw Hats were scattered by Bortholomew Kuma, and 500 pirates were captured. This was because they were trying to save Camie from being sold into slavery and Hatchan was shot by Charlos, which angered Luffy since he now considered Hatchan as a friend.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Amazon Lily: </strong>Managed to prevent Hancock from killing three of her warriors and covering her sister Sandersonia's back to prevent her slave mark from being exposed. Wanting to save Ace from execution, Luffy convinced Hancock (who had fallen in love with him) to comply to the World Government's demand she originally ignored to go to war against Whitebeard; by doing so, he prevented her from losing her Shichibukai title and the treaty to protect Amazon Lily that goes with it. This also saved Boa Hancock's life.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Impel Down:</strong>Invaded the deep sea prison Impel Down and created a massive breakout that brought disgrace to Impel Down. Freed dangerous prisoners like Crocodile, Jinbei, Ivankov, Daz Bones etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Marineford: </strong>Invaded Marineford and got involved in the Whitebeard War, had his heritage revealed, succeeded in releasing Ace but failed to save his life (or rather Ace saved him from being killed by Akainu), and falling into a mental collapse before being evacuated from the area.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>After the war: </strong>Snuck into Marineford a second time and rang the Ox Bell 16 times. This was, however, a diversion to the real message: a temporary tattoo on his arm which informed his crew to meet up in two years, not three days as was originally planned. His actions during the war earned him a new bounty
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Time Skip: </strong>The Straw Hat Pirates plan to meet up in 2 years and all of them dedicate themselves to training to face the New World.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reunion to Sabaody Archipelago: </strong>After 2 years have passed, the Straw Hats come back into the world spotlight. Sanji, Luffy and Zoro showcase their strength against a couple of Pacifista's simply because it was in the way and their re-appearance exposed the Fake Straw Hat Crew.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fish-Man Island: </strong>Intervened in a coup 'd'état staged by the New Fish-Man Pirates and the Flying Pirates, defeating them and saving the Neptune Royal Family and the island. Later, having befriended the citizens of Fish-Man Island, Luffy declared war on Big Mom and her crew for ownership of Fish-Man Island. They attempted to recruit Jinbe, who refused, saying that he has some business to take care of before he is able to join them.

                        </li>

The assassination of Big Mom is unsuccesful but they manage to save Germa and successfully escape from Big Mom's territory.
